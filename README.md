# Newcamd client in TypeScript

Implementation of client Newcamd protocol.

## Installation

```sh
npm install newcamd-client
```

## How to

There are implemented a few methods which they are able to perform within Newcamd server.

```ts
import { connect } from 'newcamd-client';

const connection = await connect({
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 1234,
});
const client = await connection.login({
  username: 'test',
  password: 'test',
  desKey: '0102030405060708091011121314',
});
const card = await client.getCard(); // { caid: '4326', providers: [ '001234', '009876' ] }

connection.close();
```

The code snipped above is able to connect to a server, log in and get card info (caid and providers list).

## Logger

The `connect` method allows passing a logger witch able to follow the communication with the server. The logger can [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino), `console` or any object with `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace` functions.

```ts
const connection = await connect({
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 1234,
  logger: console,
});
```

The output for the whole process like above should look like this:

## Why

Actually, because I can ðŸ˜„ The Newcamd protocol is a real piece of obsolete, and ancient way to exchange messages. It uses a fully binary data format encrypted with 3DES. No JSON, no XML, no Protobuf, just simple, blazing-fast bitwise beauty.
I was curious if TypeScript will able me to implement useful client, and it could!

I'm not planning to implement the more message types, like exchanging ECM, DW, etc.
