# Newcamd client in TypeScript

Implementation of client Newcamd protocol.

## Installation

```sh
npm install newcamd-client
```

## How to

There are implemented of a few methods which they are able to perform within Newcamd server.

```ts
import { connect } from 'newcamd-client';

const connection = await connect({
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 1234,
});
const client = await connection.login({
  username: 'test',
  password: 'test',
  desKey: '0102030405060708091011121314',
});
const card = await client.getCard();

connection.close();
```

The code snipped above able to connect to server, log in and get card info (caid and providers list).

## Logger

The `connect` method allow to pass a logger with able to follow the communication with server. The logger can be any object with `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace` functionsm like [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) or just `console`.

```ts
import { connect } from 'newcamd-client';

const connection = await connect({
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 1234,
  logger: console,
});
```

The output should looks like below

> Connecting to Newcamd server 127.0.0.1:1234
> Successfully connected to server. Waiting for initial message...
> Received initial message: 27b5770bcb9b75671b957b26e216

## Why

Actually, because I can ðŸ˜„ The Newcamd protocol is a real piece of obsolete, and ancient way to exchange messages. It uses a fully binary data format encrypted with 3DES. No JSON, no XML, no Protobuf, just simple, blazing-fast bitwise beauty.
I was curious if TypeScript will able me to implement useful client, and it could!

I'm not planning to implement the more message types, like exchanging ECM, DW, etc.
